Source implementation of the Shamus Restaurant site. A simple and tasteful restaurant site setup for owner managed CMS with Django 1.8, Bootstrap 2, CSS 3.

I'm not a web developer but I did this project to help out a family friend.

Check it out in deployment (code differs slightly) [here](http://shamuslockport.com)
